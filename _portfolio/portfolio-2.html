title: "Algorithm of Generating Auxetic Networks."
excerpt: "Use pruning strategy to generate auxetic material from the grometry of packed moleculars. This project was implemented on the Google Could Service(GCP) with 96-core CPUs. The auxetic samples were ment to be one of the types in my machine learning dataset. This idea is based on [Auxetic metamaterials from disordered networks](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/7/E1384).<br/><img src='/images/pruning.png'>"
