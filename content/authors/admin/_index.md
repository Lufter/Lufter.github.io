>*The Shire once raised some valiant hearts, who seek to carry the burden and preserve their beloving world. I wish to have this courage in my future expedition to the temple of quantum science.*

I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Civil Engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. My coursework included, *Quantum Physics I&II, Electromagnetism I&II, Solid State Physics, Quantum Information, Computational Theory, Engineering Electronics, and Material Science*. I worked on my undergraduate research in MatterwaveLab with [Prof. Pei-Chen, Kuan](https://thelm2005.wixsite.com/website) and AI MaterialLab with [Prof. Yun-Che, Wang](http://myweb.ncku.edu.tw/~yunche/). 

My previous research experiences involved [quantum walks (Theory and Experiments)](https://lufteracademy.netlify.app/project/mwqw/), [quantum machine learning](https://lufteracademy.netlify.app/project/ibmq-camp-2020/), [material microstructural design](https://lufteracademy.netlify.app/project/microdesign/). But I am passionate about conducting experiments and manipulating fancy instruments! With my background in science and engineering, it is always interesting to put theories into action. I am now researching some qubit realization methods, including [transmon or fluxonium qubits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06560.pdf) or even [trapped-ion qubits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04178.pdf). My vision also open to physical implementations in quantum science such as building *hybrid quantum systems, quantum random access memory and the fabrication of quantum machines*.
