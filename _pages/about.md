The Shire once raised some valiant hearts, who seek to carry the burden and preserve their beloving world. I wish to have this courage in my future expedition to the temple of quantum science.

I recieved my B.S. degree in [Civil Engineering department](http://www.civil.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?lang=en), National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. I worked on my undergraduate research in [Physics department](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/2012/en/) [MatterwaveLab](https://thelm2005.wixsite.com/website) with [Prof. Pei-Chen, Kuan](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/db/pweb/teacher.php?user_id=170222) and AI MaterialLab with [Prof. Yun-Che, Wang](http://myweb.ncku.edu.tw/~yunche/). 

My previous research experiences involved quantum computing/information and machine learning, including quantum walk, quantum machine/systems, large scale image regression, and adversarial model for material microstructural design. Most of my projects are computer simulating physics since this is the best way to embrace quantum engineering in my previous academic institution. 

With my background in science and engineering, it is always interesting to put theories into action. I am now researching some qubit realization methods, including transmon or fluxonium qubits or even trapped-ion qubits. 

My vision also open to physical implementations in quantum science such as building hybrid quantum systems, the realization of qubits, and the fabrication of quantum machines.
