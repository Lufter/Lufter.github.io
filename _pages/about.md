I recieved my B.S. degree in [Civil Engineering department](http://www.civil.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?lang=en), National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. Now working on my undergraduate research in [Physics department](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/2012/en/) [MatterwaveLab](https://thelm2005.wixsite.com/website) with [Prof. Pei-Chen, Kuan](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/db/pweb/teacher.php?user_id=170222) and AI MaterialLab with [Prof. Yun-Che, Wang](http://myweb.ncku.edu.tw/~yunche/). 

My research interest is quantum computing/information and machine learning, including quantum walk, quantum machine/systems, large scale image regression ,and adversarial model for material microstructural design.

Most of my projects are computer simulating physics. But, also open to investigate real phyisical experiments in quantum science.
