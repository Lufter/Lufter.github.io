The shire once raised some valiant hearts, who seek to carry the burden and preserve the world.

I recieved my B.S. degree in [Civil Engineering department](http://www.civil.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?lang=en), National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. Now working on my undergraduate research in [Physics department](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/2012/en/) [MatterwaveLab](https://thelm2005.wixsite.com/website) with [Prof. Pei-Chen, Kuan](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/db/pweb/teacher.php?user_id=170222) and AI MaterialLab with [Prof. Yun-Che, Wang](http://myweb.ncku.edu.tw/~yunche/). 


My research experiences involved quantum computing/information and machine learning, including quantum walk, quantum machine/systems, large scale image regression ,and adversarial model for material microstructural design.Most of my projects are computer simulating physics, since this is the best way to embrace quantum engineering in my previous academic institution. 

But, my vision also open to phyisical experiments in quantum science such as building hybrid quantum systems, realization of qubits and the fabrication of quantum machines throgh superconduction and trap ion methods.
