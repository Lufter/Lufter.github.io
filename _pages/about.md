The Shire once raised some valiant hearts, who seek to carry the burden and preserve their beloving world. I wish to have this courage in my future expedition to the temple of quantum science.

I recieved my B.S. degree in [Civil Engineering department](http://www.civil.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?lang=en), National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. I worked on my undergraduate research in [Physics department](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/2012/en/) [MatterwaveLab](https://thelm2005.wixsite.com/website) with [Prof. Pei-Chen, Kuan](http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/db/pweb/teacher.php?user_id=170222) and AI MaterialLab with [Prof. Yun-Che, Wang](http://myweb.ncku.edu.tw/~yunche/). 

My previous research experiences involved quantum computing, quantum information and machine learning. Including [quantum walk](https://lufter.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/), quantum algorithms, [large scale image regression, and adversarial model for material microstructural design](https://lufter.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/). Most of my projects were related to computer simulating physics since this is the best way to embrace quantum engineering in my previous academic institution. But I am passionate about conducting experiments and manipulating fancy instruments!

With my background in science and engineering, it is always interesting to put theories into action. I am now researching some qubit realization methods, including [transmon or fluxonium qubits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06560.pdf) or even [trapped-ion qubits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04178.pdf). 

My vision also open to physical implementations in quantum science such as building hybrid quantum systems, the realization of qubits, and the fabrication of quantum machines.
